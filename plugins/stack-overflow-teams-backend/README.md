# Stack Overflow Teams Backend Plugin

## Areas of Responsibility

The **Stack Overflow for Teams Backend plugin** is responsible for:

  

-  **Indexing all questions** from the private Stack Overflow instance (an enhanced version of the existing community plugins in the Backstage repository).

-  **Handling API requests** via ``createStackOverflowApi`` and ``createStackOverflowService`` to the Stack Overflow instance for retrieving:

-  `/users`

-  `/tags`

-  `/questions`

- Posting new questions via `/questions`

-  **Managing OAuth authentication flow** to securely access Stack Overflow private instances via ``createStackOverflowAuth``

  

## OAuth Authentication Flow

  

The backend is the only component that directly utilizes **Stack Overflow access tokens** for requests.

#### **`/auth/start`**

- Generates **PKCE Code Verifier**.

- Hashes Code Verifier to obtain **Code Challenge**.

- Generates a **state** (random string).

- Stores **Code Verifier** and **State** in a **secure, HTTP-only cookie** accessible only to the server.

  

#### **`/callback`**

- Retrieves the stored **Code Verifier** and **State**.

- Validates that the received **state** matches the one from Stack Overflow's query string parameter.

- The backend requests an **Access Token** using the stored **Code Verifier**.

- Stores the **Stack Overflow Access Token** in a **secure, HTTP-only cookie**.

  
  

## Installation

  

This plugin is installed via the `backstage-plugin-stack-overflow-teams-backend` package. To install it to your backend package, run the following command:

  

```bash

# From your root directory

yarn  --cwd  packages/backend  add  backstage-plugin-stack-overflow-teams-backend

```

  

Then add the plugin to your backend in `packages/backend/src/index.ts`:

  

```ts

const backend =  createBackend();

// ...

backend.add(import('backstage-plugin-stack-overflow-teams-backend'));

```

  

## Development

  

This plugin backend can be started in a standalone mode from directly in this

package with `yarn start`. It is a limited setup that is most convenient when

developing the plugin backend itself.

  

If you want to run the entire project, including the frontend, run `yarn dev` from the root directory.
