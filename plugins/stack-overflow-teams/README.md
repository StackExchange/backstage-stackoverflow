# Stack Overflow Teams Frontend Plugin

 ## Areas of responsibility

This package is the **frontend component** of the `stack-overflow-teams` plugin for Backstage. It provides the UI and interacts with the [backend service](https://github.com/EstoesMoises/backstage-stackoverflow/tree/main/plugins/stack-overflow-teams-backend) to fetch data from your Stack Overflow Enterprise instance.

### Backend Dependency

To fully utilize this plugin, you must also install and configure the corresponding **backend package** (`backstage-plugin-stack-overflow-teams-backend`) in your Backstage backend. The frontend plugin relies on the backend for API communication and authentication handling.

    onClick={() =>  window.dispatchEvent(new  Event('openAskQuestionModal'))}
    
    text="Ask a Question"
    
    />

The frontend plugin creates an API Ref for StackOverflow for Teams, which can be found under the `/api` folder. **All API requests from the frontend are directed to Backstage's backend**.
