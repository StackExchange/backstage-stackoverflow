# Backstage - Stack Overflow for Teams Plugin

## Overview

The **Stack Overflow for Teams** plugins for **Backstage** integrate your private knowledge solution with your Backstage instance. These plugins provide seamless access to **Stack Overflow Teams'** most relevant data, allowing you to display the top users, top tags, and top questions directly within Backstage. Additionally, it indexes all the questions from a Stack Overflow instance and integrates them into Backstage search, providing enhanced discoverability.

These plugins also allow you to securely create **Stack Overflow for Teams** questions from Backstage itself.

## Key Features

### OAuth Authentication

The plugin uses OAuth authentication to ensure that only authorised users can post questions to your Stack Overflow instance from Backstage. The OAuth process is secure, user-friendly, and integrates seamlessly with Backstage, providing a safe way to verify user identities before allowing access to question creation features.

### Top Users and Tags
Displays the top users and tags from your Stack Overflow instance, giving you insights into the most active contributors and trending topics.

### Question Indexing

### Question Creation Form

Once authenticated, users can create questions using a dedicated form within Backstage. This form features a rich text editor for formatting questions, question tips and tag autocompletion to help users categorise their questions efficiently.

## Demo Docker Image

If youâ€™d like to quickly see how this integration works without setting up your own Backstage instance, you can use my Docker image:

**`estoesmoises/stackoverflow-backstage-demo:latest`**

This image runs a Backstage instance pre-configured with the Stack Overflow for Teams plugin. You just need to pass a few environment variables when starting the container to connect it to your Stack Overflow for Teams instance.

ðŸ“– How to generate your API Access Token

Basic and Business customers can follow the official Stack Overflow for Teams guide to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) for API authentication:

ðŸ‘‰ [Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for API Authentication](https://stackoverflowteams.help/en/articles/10908790-personal-access-tokens-pats-for-api-authentication)

This token should have read-only access and no expiration to be used for indexing questions into Backstage search.
